        <p className=" text-gray-700 py-2">
          I have completed my BS in Economics from the University of Gujrat. I
          am excited to launch my career in the dynamic and rewarding field of
          Web Development. I have almost two years of experience in WordPress
          and have spent several months gaining expertise in content writing.
          Additionally, I possess knowledge of React Native, which complements
          my skill set in developing versatile and responsive web solutions and
          mobile applications.
